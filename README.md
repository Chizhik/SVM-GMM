# SVM-GMM
My implementation of SVM and GMM using python and numpy

## Problem 1
**Support Vector Machines**. In this problem, I implement SVM that supports the kernel trick.

1. Download the training data: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary/a1a. Prepare 5 training and validating pairs for 5-fold cross validation: Randomly partition this
training data into 5 (almost) equal sized subsets. A single subset is retained as the validation and the remaining 4 are used for train-
ing, at a time. Keep these training and validation pairs for other problems below.
